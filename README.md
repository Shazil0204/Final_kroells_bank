# Final_kroells_bank

2 week project, collaboration between H1 and H3.
We decided to create a bank, which runs on 2 servers, a database and some C# admin website, in OOP.

We use a ORM framework for our database calls and a rest api for a client-userinterface.
This website is a single page application, written in flutter, which also gets an app with the same functionality.

The data between the rest-api and the client is encrypted.
